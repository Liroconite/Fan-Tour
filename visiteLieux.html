                            The Osteria group is a family-run restaurant group, with several locations throughout New Zealand including Matamata, Mount Maunganui & Ohakune.
An osteria in Italy originated in 13th century Venice & was originally a place which served wine and simple food. The name evokes the hospitality of ancient local inns which date back to Roman times, a place to eat, drink and be merry. 
Our modern-day osterias retain this ambience but have evolved over the years to be more sophisticated venues for food as well as serving more varieties of wine.
